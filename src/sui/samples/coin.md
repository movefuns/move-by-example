# Create a Coin

Publishing a coin is Sui is almost as simple as publishing a new type. However it is a bit tricky as it requires using a [One Time Witness](/basics/one-time-witness.md).

```move
{{#include ../examples/sources/samples/coin.move:4:}}
```

The `Coin<T>` is a generic implementation of a Coin on Sui. Owner of the `TreasuryCap` gets control over the minting and burning of coins. Further transactions can be sent directly to the `sui::coin::Coin` with `TreasuryCap` object as authorization.
